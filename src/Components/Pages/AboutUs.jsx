                    <p>
                        TangibleTokenz makes super premium, wallet-verified, custom merch for NFT collectors.
                        Unlike other custom merch projects, TT is the only verifies NFT ownership of every item we make. “Uploading a screenshot of your NFT” betrays the very ethos of Web3.
                        Our incredibly comfortable custom threads give NFT owners the only way to make and rock merch that is provably theirs.
